This repo is a study of "Resolving The Fan Trap with Sigma and Snowflake UDF" published by Sigma Analytics using Microsoft Power BI. https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/tables_fan_traps/index.html#0 <br>
This study uses the sample .csv files available in step 2, "Data Modeling" of the walk through. https://quickstarts.sigmacomputing.com/guide/tables_fan_traps/index.html#1 <br>
I used Power BI instead of Sigma and did not use Snowflake.   <br>
